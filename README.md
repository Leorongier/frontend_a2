Movie Recommendation System Frontend 🎥
About The Project
This project is the frontend component of a movie recommendation system, designed to provide movie suggestions based on a user's watchlist. The frontend is built with Streamlit, an open-source app framework perfect for machine learning and data science projects.

The interface allows users to:

🔍 Search for movies with autocompletion features.
🌟 Get movie recommendations.
🎬 Manage a personal watchlist.
This application communicates with a Flask backend to fetch movie data and recommendations, which in turn interfaces with a BigQuery database and the TMDB API for rich movie details.
